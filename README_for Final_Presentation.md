# Project Topic: Multilayer Perceptron / Neural Network

* This project will  demonstrate the implementation of a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). 
    1. It consists of an input layer of nodes that receive data.
    2. Hidden layer(s) of nodes that evaluate and specify the relationship between inputs and outputs.
    3. An output layer which provides approximated results using linear algebra.

* This project is provided to showcase a method designed for classification, recognition, prediction and approximation.

* To get started clone this repository onto your local network and navigate to the ds5020_mlp_project directory in your terminal.

* type "make mlp" to run the mlp model

* Repo Directories:    
    - data: contains the data files for the mlp model
    - src: contains the source code for the mlp models
