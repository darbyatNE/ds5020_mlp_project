# Project Topic: Multilayer Perceptron / Neural Network

* This project will  demonstrate the implementation of a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). 
    1. It consists of an input layer of nodes that receive data.
    2. Hidden layer(s) of nodes that evaluate and specify the relationship between inputs and outputs.
    3. An output layer which provides approximated results using linear algebra.

* This project is provided to showcase a method designed for classification, recognition, prediction and approximation.

* To get started with regression type "make plot" in the command line

* Repo Directories:    
    - data: contains the data files for the regression/mlp models
    - src: contains the source code for the regression/mlp models
